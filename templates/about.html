        <h3>Hi, I'm Leland Britton</h3>
        <p>I’m a 17-year-old self-taught web developer based in Sterling, Kansas. I started BrittonWeb because I believe every small business — no matter how new or local — deserves a clean, professional website that actually helps them grow.</p>

        <p>I first got into coding when I was just 7, learning about how applications/wesites were created was fascinating to me, fast forward a decade and I am still invested in the idea of creating working applicationsand being a service to the community around me with affordable pricings and reliable communication.</p>

        <h3>How I Work</h3>
        <p>My websites are 100% hand-coded — no templates, no page builders. That means your site is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fully mobile-friendly</li>
          <li>Fast and lightweight</li>
          <li>Search engine optimized (SEO)</li>
          <li>Tailored to your business and your brand</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether you're running a gym, barbershop, or local shop, I’ll help you build a site that works hard for your business and looks good doing it.</p>

        <h3>What You Can Expect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Honest, upfront pricing</li>
          <li>Friendly communication</li>
          <li>Quick turnaround time</li>
          <li>Clean design that works across devices</li>
